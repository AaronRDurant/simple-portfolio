I use this portfolio website to demonstrate a few basic skills and display the projects I worked on when I was first learning to code via CareerFoundry's [Full-Stack Web Development Program](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/). My actual personal website is [aarondurant.com](https://www.aarondurant.com).
